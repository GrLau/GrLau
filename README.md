## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Grant and I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer science and Business Administration at Northeastern University.
I have skills in Python and have worked on multiple projects leveraging AI and machine learning to predict hotel reservation cancellations
and stock prices. I'm passionate about solving finance-related problems using code to further my personal finance goals. I'm personally
trying to break into the fintech space to combine my passions in finance and solving problems using technology and programming. I also
aspire to learn more about real estate investing as it relates to my goals of financial freedom.
